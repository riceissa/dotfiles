;; Emacs already binds C-; to flyspell-auto-correct-previous-word. However, in my experience this command has a couple of bugs:
;; 1. Sometimes it shifts the screen as if I had typed C-l or something
;; 2. It often misses misspelled words (that actually have a red squiggly underline) that are closer to point and tries to fix words farther away from point
;; 3. Possibly related to the bug in (1), if I have multiple copies of the same buffer (at different locations) open in different panes, then the pane that I am not in will also be shifted
;; I may eventually need to roll my own elisp code to get the behavior I want (basically Vim's insert-mode C-x C-s), but I did notice while playing around the flyspell mode has this other command to look backwards to fix a spelling mistake, so I'll be trying it for now.
