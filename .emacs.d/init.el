;; (set-face-attribute 'default nil
;;                     :font font-name
;;                     :height font-height
;;                     :background "white"  ;; equivalent to #ffffff
;;                     :foreground "gray20" ;; equivalent to #333333
;;                     )
;; 2. reopen emacs
;; 3. M-x customize-create-theme
;; 4. Save the theme and give it some name; I've called it issa-test
;; 5. M-x customize-themes
;; 6. Pick the theme you just created. This will trigger a dialogue box that
;;    asks you whether to mark it as safe, so say "yes" to it. This gets saved as
;;    a hash in custom-safe-themes.
;; 7. Now you have the default emacs theme as a named theme that you can use
;;    with auto-dark!
