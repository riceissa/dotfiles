# Reading mail with IMAP
#======================================================================#

set imap_user = "riceissa@gmail.com"
# If you use two-factor authentication, Gmail prevents the use of your regular
# password in apps (such as mutt), so this should be an app password
# specifically generated for use with external applications.

# The value of "folder" can be accessed later using "+". I don't think
# specifying the protocol is necessary here since we also force TLS above with
# "ssl_force_tls".
set folder = "imaps://imap.gmail.com:993"
set spoolfile = "+INBOX"

# Gmail automatically saves sent email to +[Gmail]/Sent, so leave "record" as
# the default. This prevents duplicates in Gmail. This comment and the
# following commented line (which just sets "record" to the default) is left
# here because many guides on setting up Gmail with mutt try to set "record" to
# a remote location.
# set record = "~/sent"

# Keep IMAP connection alive by polling intermittently (time in seconds). The
# value 900 seems to be common, though I have also seen 300.

# See "sort" and "sort_aux" in `man muttrc` for more ways to sort messages.
# Personally I find mutt's threads confusing and none of the options
# particularly compelling so I usually just read my mail through the Gmail web
# interface.

# if you want this instead.

# There are two ways to specify the login information for SMTP. The first is to
# use only "smtp_url" and to encode both the username and password in this
# option. The second is to set "smtp_url" with the username and to separately
# set "smtp_pass" with the password. I don't think it really matters which
# approach is taken, but here I use the second approach.
