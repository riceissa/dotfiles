# Issa Rice's dotfiles

This repository stores configuration files for some common command-line
programs. This repository supersedes previous program-specific configuration
repositories like my old [Vim](https://github.com/riceissa/vim) and
[Neovim](https://github.com/riceissa/neovim) repositories.

To install, run `install.sh` with the program names as arguments, for instance:

    ./install vim tmux

# History

I think parts of my vimrc date back to sometime in 2010 or 2011 when I really
first started using Vim (my
[really old Vim repo](https://github.com/riceissa/vim-old "Originally at riceissa/.vim.")
was created on July 7, 2012 and
[old Vim repo](https://github.com/riceissa/vim) was created in May 2014; on a Git
repository that I don't think I ever mirrored to a public place, I have a
`.vimrc` with commit timestamp `Mon Aug 22 20:36:58 2011 -0700`, which *might*
be the first). This repository itself began in August 2015.
