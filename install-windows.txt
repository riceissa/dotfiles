Installation instructions for Windows 10
Written on 2024-12-29

Unlike what I believed for over 3 years on Windows 10, Windows 10 actually does
have symlinks. The twist is that apparently only administrators can create
symlinks. So we have to open the command prompt as an admin and run the
symlink-creating commands.

On Windows 10, open cmd as administrator by pressing the Windows key on the
keyboard, typing "cmd", right clicking "Command prompt" and picking from the
menu "Run as administrator". Then just copy each of the commands below as
needed to create the symlinks:

mklink "C:\Users\Issa\.emacs.d\init.el" "C:\Users\Issa\projects\dotfiles\.emacs.d\init.el"

mklink "C:\Users\Issa\.vimrc" "C:\Users\Issa\projects\dotfiles\.vimrc"

mklink "C:\Users\Issa\.bashrc" "C:\Users\Issa\projects\dotfiles\.bashrc-gitbash"

mklink "C:\Users\Issa\AppData\Local\nvim\init.vim" "C:\Users\Issa\projects\dotfiles\.vimrc"

mklink "C:\Users\Issa\.cvsignore" "C:\Users\Issa\projects\dotfiles\.cvsignore"

mklink "C:\Users\Issa\.gitconfig" "C:\Users\Issa\projects\dotfiles\.gitconfig-gitbash"
